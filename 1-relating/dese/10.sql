-- In Massachusetts, school district expenditures are in part determined by local taxes on property (e.g., home) values.
-- In 10.sql, write a SQL query to find the 10 public school districts with the highest per-pupil expenditures.
-- Your query should return the names of the districts and the per-pupil expenditure for each.

SELECT name, expenditures.per_pupil_expenditure FROM districts
JOIN expenditures ON expenditures.district_id == districts.id
WHERE type == "Public School District"
ORDER BY expenditures.per_pupil_expenditure DESC LIMIT 10;
